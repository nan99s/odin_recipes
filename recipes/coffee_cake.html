                <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Looking for everyone's favorite comfort-food coffee cake? This is it. Soft and moist, nicely cinnamon-y, this is the quintessential breakfast coffee cake.</p>

                    <p>Note: For those of you looking for a cake with less filling, one where the golden cake itself is the main attraction, reduce the amount of brown sugar in the filling to 1/3 cup (71g), keeping the remaining ingredients the same.</p>
