                <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Looking for everyone's favorite comfort-food coffee cake? This is it. Soft and moist, nicely cinnamon-y, this is the quintessential breakfast coffee cake.</p>
                    <p>Note: For those of you looking for a cake with less filling, one where the golden cake itself is the main attraction, reduce the amount of brown sugar in the filling to 1/3 cup (71g), keeping the remaining ingredients the same.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan</li>
                        <li>Make the topping by whisking together the sugar, salt, flour, and cinnamon. Add the metled butter, stirring until well combined. Set the topping aside.</li>
                        <li>Make the filling by mixing together the brown sugar, cinnamon, and cocoa powder. Note that the cocoa powder is used strictly for color, not flavor; leave it out if you like. Set it aside.</li>
                        <li>To make the cake, in a large bowl. beat together the butter, salt, sugars, baking powder, and vanilla until well combined and smooth.</li>
                        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
                        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the sour cream or yogurt and milk till well combined. You don't need to whisk out all the lumps.</li>
                        <li>Add the flour to the butter mixture alternately with the milk/sour cream mixture, beating gently to combine.</li>
                        <li>Spread the batter into the prepared pan, spreading all the way to the edges.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle the filling evenly on the batter.</li>
                        <li>Spread the remaining batter atop the filling. Use a table knife to genlty swirl the filling into the batter, as though you are making a marble cake. Don't combine filling and batter thoroughly; just swirl the filling through the batter.</li>
                        <li>Bake the cake until its a dark golden brown around the edges. 55 to 60 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool for 20 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
